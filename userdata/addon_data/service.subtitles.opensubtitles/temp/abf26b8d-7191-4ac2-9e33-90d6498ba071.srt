CITY OF GOD

3
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:57,590
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Go on, for fuck's sake!

5
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,640
Get that chicken!

6
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,290
If it’s a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

7
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,650
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

8
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,490
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

9
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,400
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

10
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,310
Get that chicken, bro!

11
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,600
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

12
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,940
Outta my way!

13
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,150
Get that chicken!

14
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,500
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

15
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,140
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

16
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,720
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

17
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,590
Shit! The cops!

18
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,060
Don't fucking run off!

19
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,060
Give me that.

20
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,140
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

21
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,700
A picture could change
my life, but...

22
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,170
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

23
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,240
...and if you stay, they get you too.
-They’re coming for us!

24
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,110
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

25
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,760
THE SIXTIES

26
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,100
You’re useless, man!

27
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,130
-Go get the ball!
-Fucking useless!

28
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,430
Hey, kid!

29
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,670
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

30
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,010
-It’s not yours.
-You wanna mess with me?

31
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,650
Fuck off.

32
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,020
-What’s your name?
-Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

33
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,750
-My name’s Rocket.
-Some advice, Rocket...

34
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,520
Don’t let Li’l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

35
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,020
-You lose, pal.
-Go, Shaggy!

36
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,460
That's Shaggy.

37
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,070
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

38
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,300
8, 9, 10, 11...

39
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,980
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

40
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,380
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck’s coming.
What are you fucking around for?

41
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,520
You’re not gonna chicken out...

42
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,380
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

43
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,520
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

44
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,290
Shaggy...

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,670
Clipper...

46
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,810
and Goose.

47
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,470
Tagging along were always
Li’l Dice and Benny...

48
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,610
Shaggy's brother.

49
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,550
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

50
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,100
Okay, let’s go.

51
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,890
Come on, Goose.

52
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,660
Let’s go!

53
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,610
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

54
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,220
Stop or I’ll shoot, motherfucker!

55
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,720
Get out!

56
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,190
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

57
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,060
Who wants gas?

58
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,170
More! You wanna die for your
boss’ damn money?

59
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,370
Shitloads of money here!

60
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,820
You see, asshole?

61
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,980
Asshole!

62
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,160
Fuck! The cops!

63
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,590
Let’s get outta here!

64
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,360
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

65
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,380
-Shaggy!
-The ball, Goose, it’s yours!

66
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,930
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

67
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,300
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

68
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,940
Here! Buy some new balls.

69
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,940
But they were just amateurs.

70
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,810
-Even my brother, Goose.
-Rocket, give this money to dad.

71
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,290
But don’t tell him it’s from me.

72
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,720
Okay?

73
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,920
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

74
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,390
Look how much I’ve got.

75
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,610
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

76
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,480
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

77
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,090
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

78
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,230
-A light post!
-We’ll have electricity!

79
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,590
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

80
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,730
Homeless? Off to City of God!

81
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,000
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

82
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,400
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

83
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,610
We were too far removed...

84
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,280
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,730
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

86
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,770
I don’t know.

87
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,840
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

88
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,570
I don’t want to sell fish.
It stinks.

89
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,480
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

90
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,180
So what do you want to be?

91
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,210
I don’t know.

92
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,010
-Not a hood or a policeman.
-Why not?

93
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,380
I’m scared of getting shot.

94
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,330
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

95
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,020
Pointing that gun at me?

96
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,470
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li’l Dice is with me.

97
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,510
Right, I'm a gangster too.

98
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,340
-That gas truck didn't bring much.
-So what?

99
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,170
-We rob gas trucks every day.
-One today, another tomorrow.

100
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,680
No, we need to rob
some rich guy’s house.

101
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,320
That’s the only
way to get outta here.

102
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,820
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

103
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,460
That’s it.

104
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,750
The little fart’s getting
too big for his britches!

105
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,070
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

106
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,440
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

107
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,310
What you got in mind, Li’l Dice?

108
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,110
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

109
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,420
And Li’l Dice had them.

110
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,080
-Is that the motel?
-Yeah.

111
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,230
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

112
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,770
-I need this.
-Don’t touch my gun, kid.

113
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,170
Don’t ever do that again.

114
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,960
-Don’t point at me.
-Fuck you.

115
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,840
-Don’t point your finger at me!
-Stop acting like a baby!

116
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,740
Here’s yours.

117
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,350
-Awesome!
-Let’s go!

118
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,070
-Not so fast!
-What?

119
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,750
You stay here and keep watch.

120
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,320
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

121
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,430
-Why me? Let that dork do that.
-Look...

122
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,830
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy’s absolutely useless!

123
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,800
-You just had the idea.
-Exactly!

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
You’re just a kid, remember?

125
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,840
You cover us, okay?

126
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,610
You’ll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

127
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,310
You stay there.

128
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,250
This is a hold-up, bitch.

129
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,030
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

130
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,230
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

131
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,310
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

132
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
Okay, Clipper?

133
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
Shall we go in?

134
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,090
I didn't order anything.

135
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,420
It’s on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

136
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,890
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

137
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,690
-Don’t point that...
-Your wallet...

138
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,630
Hey, man...

139
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,040
What kind of whorehouse is this?

140
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,840
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

141
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,910
Give it to me!

142
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,420
Slut!

143
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
You're old, fat and flabby!

144
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,730
Wanna take her place?

145
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,370
What’s going on?

146
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,200
-The cops! Let’s beat it!
-Let’s go!

147
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,840
Take that car.
I'll go get Li’l Dice.

148
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,650
Jesus, what a car!

149
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,400
-Something fucked up. Li’l Dice’s gone.
-The cops are shooting, let’s go!

150
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,830
Slow down! Hold on...

151
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,860
-You said you knew how to drive.
-I do, so cool it!

152
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,760
Turn! Watch out!

153
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,150
You fucking asshole!

154
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,910
Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose.

155
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,750
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

156
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,430
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

157
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,960
Goose fucked up his ankle.

158
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,160
It fucking hurts.

159
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,270
Take him into the woods.
I’ll shoot to distract the cops.

160
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,810
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

161
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,980
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

162
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,090
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

163
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,310
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

164
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,220
-It fucking hurts, Goose.
-Shut up.

165
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,660
-Wait up...
-You sound like a damn sissy, man.

166
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,000
-Give me your hand! Climb up!
-No one saw anything?

167
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,040
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

168
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,240
I suppose you didn’t see
anything either?

169
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,180
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

170
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,380
So what’s up, Shorty?

171
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,820
They’re hiding in the woods.

172
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,490
-Hello, Melonhead.
-How are you doing?

173
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,130
I have this feeling that
they’re out in the woods.

174
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,930
-The motherfuckers.
-They’re out in the woods.

175
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,870
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

176
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,540
I can’t see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

177
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,180
Fucking jungle.

178
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,520
-They stole a fortune at that motel.
-I know.

179
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,520
What if we took the money?

180
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,200
Are you crazy?
I’m not getting mixed up in that.

181
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,960
I want to exterminate these guys.

182
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,470
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

183
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:43,480
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

184
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:15,010
-Did you hear those shots?
-If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

185
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,280
Maracana!

186
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,790
Open the door.

187
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,800
-What’s the matter?
-The cops are after me.

188
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,580
Shaggy!

189
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,650
-Shaggy!
-The cops are on my ass!

190
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,080
-Hide me!
-Quick, come in.

191
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,260
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

192
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,500
I had a vision, Goose.

193
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,970
You been smoking something?

194
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,140
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah.

195
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,400
What’s it like?
What do people say?

196
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,740
I worked with my father.

197
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,510
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

198
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,780
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

199
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,400
-This gangster’s life isn’t for me.
-Wait! The cops are still down there.

200
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,260
I don’t give a shit.

201
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,100
I'm going back to the church.

202
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,800
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

203
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,370
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

204
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,840
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

205
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,280
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

206
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,510
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

207
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,590
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don’t move!

208
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,360
Stop, or I’ll shoot!

209
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,030
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

210
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,000
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

211
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,040
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

212
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,680
I don’t think this guy
was involved in the heist.

213
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,580
See here?

214
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,190
-He’s a worker, not a hoodlum.
-I’ll make him one now.

215
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,760
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

216
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,460
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

217
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,630
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

218
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,330
Why do you do these things?
You think I’m a fool?

219
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,240
From now on,
you’ll work with me.

220
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,610
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

221
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,810
You listen to me.

222
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,390
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

223
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,460
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

224
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,430
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

225
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,900
Don’t worry.
Dad’s mad at me...

226
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,510
but he’ll get over it.

227
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:40,710
Give me that, Rocket. It’s not
for you. You have to study.

228
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,250
-Getting shot doesn’t scare you?
-I’m a hood because I got no brain.

229
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,290
But you’re smart.
You should study.

230
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,090
I go to school because
I don’t like physical work.

231
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,230
Promise me something... That you’ll
never touch this gun. Promise?

232
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,030
Let’s shake.

233
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,100
We’d better hurry.

234
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,910
I’m gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don’t laugh.

235
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
You grinned when I got slapped.

236
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,980
-Who, me?
-I saw you.

237
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,440
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

238
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,250
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

239
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,620
-I'm thinking of what to say to you.
-You’re thinking, as well?

240
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,160
Don’t. It’ll be your downfall.

241
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,630
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

242
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,270
Are you pulling my leg?

243
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,630
You never heard of
love at first sight?

244
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,270
-Hoods don’t love, they desire.
-You cut down everything I say.

245
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,170
Hoods don’t talk,
they smooth-talk.

246
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,710
Well, I’ll stop wasting
my breath on you.

247
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,450
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

248
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,950
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

249
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,690
It’s not love,
it’s a con game.

250
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,410
It’s just that I love you.

251
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,040
You just might end up
convincing me...

252
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,030
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

253
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,550
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

254
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,450
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

255
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:43,230
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

256
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,540
3 MONTHS LATER

257
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,900
Shaggy...

258
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,440
Why don’t you change your life?

259
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,610
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

260
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,650
-Good-for-nothing!
-What do you mean?

261
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,820
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

262
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,890
That’s right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

263
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,960
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

264
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,730
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

265
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,810
Sure! For me, that’s
nothing but smooth-talk.

266
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,990
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

267
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,180
Are you kidding?

268
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,960
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

269
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,300
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

270
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,960
Did you see anything?
You don’t know shit, so shut up.

271
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,300
You weren’t there.
I didn’t kill anyone.

272
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,210
I bet it’s those fucking policemen,
and I’m the one taking the rap.

273
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,040
They even nabbed Li’l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

274
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,320
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn’t me.

275
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,790
Let me just say... I don’t want my
kid’s father to be a hoodlum.

276
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,390
You’re all alone, Shaggy.

277
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,500
-All alone?
-That’s right!

278
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,490
-Clipper’s gone religious.
-Hallelujah!

279
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,390
-Goose is working.
-Ass-kisser!

280
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,730
-And you?
-I haven’t changed. So what?

281
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,240
They’ve deserted me,
that’s all.

282
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,600
Then I’m deserting you too.

283
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,300
I’m splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

284
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,380
Otherwise, I’ll go alone.

285
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,060
Fish for sale!

286
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,240
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

287
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,900
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

288
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,410
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

289
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,320
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

290
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,490
I also have a kisser fish.

291
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,020
Hey, that’s a mullet!

292
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,660
Doesn’t your husband...

293
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,990
go down on you?

294
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,690
No.

295
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,230
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

296
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,100
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

297
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,510
-Good God, no. Doesn’t it hurt?
-The first few times.

298
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,450
Then you’ll see, it’s fantastic.
But you need a banana.

299
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,140
What for?

300
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,350
You’re missing the good things
in life, girl!

301
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,460
You take a banana, warm it up...

302
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,390
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

303
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,800
It’s a real rush!
Ask your husband.

304
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,770
I couldn’t. You don’t know him.
He’s liable to beat me.

305
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,670
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

306
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,620
Motherfucking nigger!

307
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,190
Slut!

308
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,760
Whoring bitch!

309
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,730
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

310
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,200
-Take them off, dammit!
-I'm not going naked in the street.

311
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,280
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

312
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,310
Give me your shirt.

313
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,250
Your shorts! Hurry up!

314
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,090
I knew it. It’s always me
who forks up for that bum.

315
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,070
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

316
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,460
-That brat there?
-I’ll castrate that fucker.

317
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,840
Fish! Fish for sale!

318
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,510
Hey, kid, come over here.

319
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,480
-Where’s your brother?
-He’s not working today.

320
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,420
-Oh yeah? Get in.
-I didn’t do anything.

321
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,610
-Get in!
-What about my fish?

322
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:34,950
-Hurry it up, kid!
-I don’t want to lose my fish!

323
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,120
-Forget your fish.
-Sit your ass down.

324
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,130
-My father will kill me.
-That doesn’t matter.

325
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,680
Let’s go.
There’s nothing here.

326
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,820
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

327
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,650
Let’s go, Felipe.

328
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,160
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

329
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,820
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

330
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,970
Li’l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

331
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:26,840
-You’re fucking loaded!
-Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

332
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,280
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

333
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,310
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

334
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,250
-I'm leaving the ghetto.
-But Shorty had his hands full...

335
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,310
Let’s go see, Stringy.

336
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,490
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

337
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,450
The tabloids went to town:

338
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,820
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

339
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,900
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

340
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,040
The hoodlums took off.

341
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,510
-You wanna die?
-It’s you who’s gonna die...

342
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,840
if you don’t do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

343
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,910
Let’s go, dammit!

344
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,850
-There are cops ahead.
-Fuck them, let’s go.

345
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,720
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

346
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,290
-What’s the matter?
-Have mercy!

347
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,430
-This car’s a piece of junk.
-My ass! Start the damn thing!

348
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,160
It needs a push.

349
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,370
Push, Shaggy!

350
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,060
Push!

351
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,720
You?

352
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,220
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

353
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,590
Nab that guy over there!

354
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,980
Run, Shaggy!

355
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,590
Stop the car!

356
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,410
-This way! He’s over here.
-We got that sonofabitch!

357
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,350
-The bastard!
-He’s a murderer.

358
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,550
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

359
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,430
and a camera.

360
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,900
I’d always wanted to have one.

361
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,540
Let’s go to school.

362
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,520
-Well?
-Let’s go to the beach.

363
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,050
But we have an exam.

364
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,920
So what?

365
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,720
Everyone else is at the beach.

366
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,920
Come on, let’s go!

367
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,530
She’s in a bikini,
but doesn’t want to go.

368
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,640
What’s that saying you have?

369
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,000
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

370
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,880
THE SEVENTIES

371
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,980
-Over here!
-I bought my first camera...

372
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,450
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

373
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,360
with the world's cheapest model.

374
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,260
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

375
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,520
Any luck getting laid yet?

376
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,820
Zilch.

377
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:18,430
-Angelica. I was crazy about her.
-So, Rocket, still clicking away?

378
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,830
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

379
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,030
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

380
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,800
With her, buddy?
She’s got a guy.

381
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,240
-So? I’m not jealous.
-Her father’s a sergeant.

382
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,280
No one’s perfect.
Closer together!

383
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,750
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

384
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:45,820
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

385
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,330
Thiago, move back a little.

386
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,340
-Is this okay?
-Perfect.

387
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
I need a joint.

388
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,290
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It’s far out.

389
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,390
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

390
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,730
If you like,
I can get it for you.

391
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,560
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

392
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,540
But the choice stuff is coke.
That’s a real nercotic.

393
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,070
Narcotic!

394
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,580
-Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
-Screw you.

395
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,380
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

396
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,080
-You’re never in the water.
-My dad’s a lifeguard.

397
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,230
-I’ll bet you a beer I swim better.
-You’re on.

398
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,830
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky’s.

399
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,940
I’d have done anything
to please her...

400
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,640
Buy her pot, coke...

401
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,190
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

402
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:33,730
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

403
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,940
-Who is it?
-Rocket.

404
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,410
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

405
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,710
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

406
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,820
-You want to buy or smoke a joint?
-Buy.

407
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,790
Come in, buddy.

408
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,850
Who is it?

409
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
This was Blacky's turf.

410
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,630
But it hadn't always been his.

411
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,640
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

412
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,110
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

413
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,080
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

414
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,280
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

415
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,900
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

416
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,800
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

417
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,070
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

418
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,470
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

419
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,390
-What about my pot?
-Stick it up your ass.

420
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,350
The best dealer...

421
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,830
...was Carrot.

422
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,660
-Can I have a sip?
-Sure.

423
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,490
He earned Big Boy's trust...

424
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,690
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

425
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,570
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

426
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,010
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

427
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:29,150
-His name was Aristotle.
-My wife needs an operation.

428
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:35,690
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

429
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,660
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

430
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,300
Here’s the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

431
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,330
-You’ve bailed me out, brother.
-Friday.

432
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,770
He’s my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

433
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:54,970
Give him another week.

434
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,710
-Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
-Carrot had no choice.

435
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,920
-I said Friday.
-Don’t do it, man.

436
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,720
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

437
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

438
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,930
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

439
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,770
but didn’t want the apartment...

440
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,850
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

441
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,780
-Here. 150 bags.
-Blacky.

442
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,110
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

443
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,590
That's how he took over
the local trade.

444
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,050
But not for long...

445
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,520
Who is it?

446
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,590
Go see.

447
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,530
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

448
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,610
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

449
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah, who?

450
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,790
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

451
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,260
My name is Li’l Z’ now.

452
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,860
THE STORY OF LI’L Z’

453
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,090
Li’l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

454
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,630
ever since he was little
and was called "Li’l Dice".

455
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,710
They’re having fun,
and not me?

456
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,790
I want to get out of here.

457
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,620
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

458
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,070
That night, Li'l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

459
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,800
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

460
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,480
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

461
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,420
He had to work hard for peanuts.

462
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,690
-Yeah, Benny!
-Li’l Dice and Benny managed well.

463
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,500
They had the gift of crime.

464
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,470
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

465
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,830
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

466
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,270
...like my brother, Goose.
-Li’l Dice?

467
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,810
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

468
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,710
You’re fucking loaded!

469
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,580
Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

470
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,490
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

471
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,220
that Shorty is squealing.
I’m leaving the ghetto.

472
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,270
Goose!

473
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,110
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

474
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,790
From one hit to the next,
Li’l Dice grew up.

475
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,400
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

476
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,660
You’re of age now, watch out!

477
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,170
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

478
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,120
Li’l Dice, how’s it going?

479
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,950
Happy birthday.
I’m so glad you’ve turned 18...

480
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,390
-Get lost, Tuba!
-Excuse me, amigo...

481
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,090
Give me a beer!

482
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,930
Didn’t you see me, prick?

483
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,000
-Sorry, man.
-Up yours!

484
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,570
The next time,
I’ll waste you, asshole!

485
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,000
Fag!

486
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,280
Li'l Dice was ready for anything.

487
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,420
I wanna talk.

488
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,610
-And he was itching to start.
-Who are the fattest cats here?

489
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,290
-There are tons of them.
-Look at Jerry Adriani...

490
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:39,590
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

491
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,990
Look at Pereira
and the chick he’s with...

492
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,070
-Bernice. She was my brother’s girl.
-Check out his car.

493
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,800
Then there’s Blacky.
Covered in gold.

494
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,670
Gold chain, gold watch...

495
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,040
Look at Carrot, and his car.

496
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,980
-They’re all dealers.
-They’re all fucking loaded.

497
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,210
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

498
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,220
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

499
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,410
Especially in selling coke.

500
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,890
-But you need money.
-Not really...

501
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,790
We’ll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

502
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,760
-When do we start?
-Now.

503
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,240
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

504
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,040
He brought you here.

505
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,450
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

506
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,730
I know what you want.
You want power.

507
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,060
I have something which will
give it to you.

508
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,090
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

509
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,900
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

510
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,580
otherwise...

511
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,050
you’ll die.

512
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,950
The boy is no longer called
Li’l Dice...

513
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,140
but Li’l Z’.

514
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,910
Li’l Z’ will grow up.

515
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,020
You stick with me,
I’ll stick with you.

516
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,760
Li’l Dice became Li'l Z'
and he began to kill.

517
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:40,480
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

518
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,050
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

519
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,660
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

520
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,820
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...

521
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,090
But that would be easy.

522
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,930
Who is it?

523
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,540
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

524
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:17,880
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

525
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,720
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

526
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,380
-My name is Li’l Z’ now.
-His name’s Li’l Z’, see?

527
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,720
-You’re a goner, bastard.
-Don’t kill him. He understands.

528
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,060
Right, Blacky?

529
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,790
It’s all yours, I don’t want anything.
I don’t want no trouble, okay?

530
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,130
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

531
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:43,710
You’ll live, but you’ll
work for us. Understand?

532
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,010
That's easy to say...

533
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,550
-Where are you going?
-He’s clean, Li’l Z’.

534
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,550
What’s your name, kid?

535
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,560
-Rocket.
-He’s Goose’s brother.

536
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,350
-Goose?
-The late Goose.

537
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,830
Quick, kid. Run along.

538
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,490
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li’l Z’.

539
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,610
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

540
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,700
Cocaine.

541
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,650
-Where’s the turf?
-Over there, on the left.

542
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,880
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

543
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,120
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

544
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,050
which is then
packaged on the premises.

545
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,190
It's done in an assembly line.

546
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,450
Boring as hell...

547
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,960
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

548
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,930
Cocaine is put into packets...

549
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,900
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

550
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,140
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

551
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,180
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

552
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,440
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

553
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,180
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

554
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:05,230
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

555
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,090
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

556
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,390
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

557
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,730
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

558
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,570
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

559
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,240
the boss' right-hand man.

560
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,620
The police receive their part
and don’t make trouble.

561
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,420
Since Li’l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

562
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,590
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

563
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,490
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

564
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,600
The City teemed with addicts
and Li’l Z' grew rich.

565
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,840
-Is it okay?
-It’s a deal.

566
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,540
-I can’t decide which to wear.
-This one’s cool.

567
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,750
If dealing were legal, Li’l Z'
would have been man of the year.

568
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,960
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

569
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,360
-And he was everywhere.
-What a drag this guy is.

570
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:22,700
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

571
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,210
Half a lid. Thanks.

572
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,510
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

573
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,050
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

574
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,060
-I was about to win her over...
-These pictures are really great.

575
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,860
-You think so?
-I look good here.

576
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,830
-You look beautiful everywhere.
-I’m serious.

577
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,030
Me too.

578
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:02,170
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

579
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,210
I was sure this was it...

580
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,410
But the Runts arrived.

581
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,250
Can I have a toke?

582
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,020
Here.

583
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,430
I’m going. See you later.

584
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,600
Hold on, Angelica.

585
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,300
-Your joint, man.
-Keep it.

586
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,840
What a cool guy.

587
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,180
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

588
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,120
-Steak and fries, Benny.
-Great! Here...

589
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:59,570
-A tip for you.
-Really? Thanks.

590
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,070
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

591
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,470
-Wanna trade this watch?
-After Angelica left him...

592
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,580
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

593
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,870
-Is it your grandfather’s?
-No, my dad’s.

594
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,380
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

595
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,720
-Two bags of ten.
-One of ten.

596
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,020
-Okay, one bag.
-For Thiago, it was different.

597
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,720
-Watch out!
-Sorry, godfather.

598
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,900
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

599
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,130
-I’m sorry.
-Now beat it.

600
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,730
Blacky, lend me your bike.

601
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,470
Hey, wanna race?

602
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,130
-Where to?
-Up to the highway.

603
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,680
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

604
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,900
-Pretty tough, wasn’t it?
-Yeah, you’re good.

605
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,440
Where’d you buy those sneakers?

606
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,230
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as well?

607
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,770
-No, uptown.
-Cool.

608
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,210
It’s a designer shirt.

609
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,750
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

610
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,610
Shorts and a shirt?

611
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,150
Buy whatever you can.

612
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,890
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

613
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,030
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand.

614
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:14,260
Shoe size? Turn around.

615
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:28,010
-Hey, Benny!
-You got the digs?

616
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,280
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there’s more.

617
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,690
-You like it?
-Yeah.

618
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,300
There’s some change.

619
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,800
-Keep it.
-Cool.

620
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,910
This is Benny.

621
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,610
-This is Rocket.
-Hi. I know him.

622
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,740
I’ve become a playboy.

623
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:36,810
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

624
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,850
Watch out...

625
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,720
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

626
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,920
Oh, yeah?

627
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,490
Fuck off, you bastards!

628
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,640
Making fun of me?

629
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,100
Asshole!

630
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,220
Benny, didn’t I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He’s endangering the ghetto.

631
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,960
-Cool it. Go talk to him.
-I’m gonna kill that fucker.

632
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:27,030
-Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
-I’m gonna kill him.

633
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:32,360
Don’t worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

634
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,170
Sure, I’m not worried.

635
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,480
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

636
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,740
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

637
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,510
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

638
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,890
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

639
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,490
Li’l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

640
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,660
to be the boss of the ghetto.

641
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:00,130
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

642
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,960
-Hey, Carrot.
-What’s up?

643
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,470
You shouldn’t let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

644
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,840
You look after your section,
I’ll look after mine.

645
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,910
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

646
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:26,690
-Hey, Rocket! How’s it going?
-Great.

647
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,960
-Hey, Benny!
-How’s it going?

648
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,700
-Hey, Thiago. How are you?
-Good.

649
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,240
-May I?
-Sure...

650
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,740
Wanna dance?

651
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,700
-Is it okay at your place?
-No problem.

652
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,580
My parents are out.
You’ll be all alone with her.

653
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,190
-You can lose your virginity tonight.
-Not so loud, man!

654
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,120
Everyone will hear.

655
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,760
-You’re beautiful.
-Thank you.

656
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,420
-Shit!
-Nothing’s happening.

657
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,940
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

658
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,810
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

659
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,210
I want to talk to you
because you’re fucking useless.

660
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,410
Get your hand away!

661
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,650
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

662
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,190
Give the baby his bottle.

663
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,790
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

664
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,400
Carrot’s useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

665
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,530
The police come around and
that’s bad for business.

666
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,400
I’ll do it only because
I like you.

667
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,400
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

668
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:49,440
I’ll show you who’s the baby...

669
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,140
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

670
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:56,820
No wonder you’re "Little" Z’!

671
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:04,930
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

672
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,580
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

673
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,990
especially in Carrot's section.

674
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,500
What are you doing?

675
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,770
-You rob me all the time!
-But they didn't know...

676
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,310
that the City had a boss now.

677
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,210
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

678
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,250
The City had become
much safer for residents.

679
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,460
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

680
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,990
You just had to go see Li’l Z'.

681
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,320
-Let’s go.
-Don’t hurt the Runts.

682
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,430
I won’t touch them.

683
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,070
-Hi, Steak.
-How’s it going, Li’l Z’?

684
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,970
-Wanna take a walk, Steak?
-With you? Hold on...

685
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,400
Mom, I’m going out with
my friends.

686
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,520
That’s the best chicken
I ever ate.

687
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,060
-The old guy was scared shitless.
-Feeling sorry for him?

688
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,290
You’re crazy, man!

689
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:34,580
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

690
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,220
-Peanuts. Drugs are where it’s at.
-Yeah, selling drugs.

691
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:45,720
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

692
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:51,160
It’s a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

693
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:55,800
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

694
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,200
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li’l Z' did.

695
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:02,100
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

696
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,140
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

697
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,810
Come back, you brat!

698
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:21,860
-They’re quick, those kids.
-They run fast.

699
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,000
They’re all gone except you.
Any others?

700
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,240
You’re gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

701
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,610
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

702
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,120
Come on, choose!

703
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,080
Hand or foot?

704
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,350
Choose, for fuck's sake!

705
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,230
-Hand.
-The little hand, eh?

706
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,210
Cool.

707
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,890
Hey, Steak’n’fries,
let’s see what you’re made of.

708
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,420
Choose and then kill
one of them.

709
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,420
-Leave it. I’ll do it.
-Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

710
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,100
Go on, Steak.

711
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,740
Go on, choose one and shoot.

712
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,960
Come on, I haven’t got all day.

713
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,010
Kill one of them.

714
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,340
Let’s go, Steak.
I’m in a hurry.

715
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,920
I wanna see what you’re made of.

716
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,930
Well done!

717
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,360
You did it.

718
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:09,370
-You’re one of us. Give me five.
-Very good, Steak.

719
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:18,710
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

720
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,850
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li’l Z”s ghetto.

721
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:26,820
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

722
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,350
Cool, Li’l Z'.

723
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:47,600
While Li’l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

724
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,050
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

725
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:56,210
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

726
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,680
I had no choice.

727
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,720
SUCKER’S LIFE

728
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,660
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

729
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:11,390
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

730
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,630
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

731
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,970
But things didn't
work out that way.

732
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,710
-It’s the guy on the beach.
-Hey, bro!

733
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:28,610
-Still smoking good stuff?
-Yeah.

734
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,480
That guy’s too cool.

735
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:33,250
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

736
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:41,630
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

737
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:45,320
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

738
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,490
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

739
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,870
You’re fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

740
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,530
I didn’t get a single cent.

741
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,490
It was like a message from God:

742
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,630
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker’."

743
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,100
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

744
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,010
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

745
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,220
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

746
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,080
It was Goose’s.
It’s broken anyway.

747
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:46,350
It’s not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

748
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:51,190
It’s never anyone’s fault.
It’s always someone else’s.

749
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,360
But it’s the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

750
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:57,700
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

751
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:02,570
I know that guy.

752
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,870
He lives in the City.
He’ll recognize us.

753
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,670
So? He couldn’t care less
if we take his boss’ money.

754
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,150
Okay. Let’s go.

755
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:16,510
Well, boys? Aren’t you from
the City of God?

756
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,260
Yeah.

757
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,620
I’ll let one of you through
without paying.

758
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,030
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

759
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,110
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

760
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,180
-Did you study?
-I was in school and in the army.

761
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,540
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

762
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,270
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

763
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,680
But I do karate.
If I’m hired somewhere...

764
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,980
I’ll leave the ghetto.

765
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,950
-Do you fight, then?
-I’m for peace and love.

766
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,800
But if I have to...

767
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,800
He didn't know he would have to.

768
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,560
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

769
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,300
-We should be going.
-Let’s go.

770
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,500
-Good bye.
-Thanks.

771
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,210
See you.

772
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,210
I couldn’t do it.
He was such a cool guy.

773
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,580
Yeah, totally.
That’s Gerson’s brother.

774
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,790
Let’s go home.

775
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:29,990
There’s nothing here
except that bakery over there.

776
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:35,070
-What will you say?
-I don’t know. "This is a hold-up."

777
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,760
Here’s my number.

778
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,170
-You like soul or groovy parties?
-Soul.

779
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,310
That one didn't work either.

780
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:46,840
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

781
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,210
Will you call me?

782
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:53,010
I couldn’t pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

783
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,020
Yeah, I agree.

784
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,000
Excuse me. I’m lost.
How do I get to Barra?

785
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,190
-To Barra?
-Yes.

786
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,200
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

787
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,430
-In fact, we were going there.
-You’re kidding.

788
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,010
-You’re a lifesaver.
-That’s right.

789
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,180
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

790
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:31,890
-The body’s over here.
-We found it, Chief.

791
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,580
The forensic expert!

792
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,170
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

793
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,680
-What a great singer.
-You like him?

794
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,220
-I love music. What about you?
-Tell me, do you also like pot?

795
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,020
I can’t say I’ve never tried it.

796
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:09,360
The devil recognizes his own.

797
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,030
-Do you have papers?
-I think so.

798
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,670
I have some.

799
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:22,040
I’d always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

800
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,640
If I’d had the same skill
with girls...

801
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:29,610
I’d never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

802
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:36,490
-For a Sao Paulo guy you’re very cool.
-Thanks, bro.

803
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:39,590
What did they use?

804
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,990
A club or a rock.
And the child?

805
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,130
-Untouched.
-Thank goodness.

806
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,100
-How long ago?
-About four hours.

807
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,300
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead.

808
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,610
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

809
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,930
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

810
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,570
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

811
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,770
-The place is crawling with cops now!
-Come on, Li’l Z'.

812
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:35,440
-Come on? Fuck you!
-I had to avenge my honor.

813
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:39,140
Her family’s turned me in.
You won’t have any problems.

814
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,850
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You’re dead meat, asshole.

815
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:45,920
Let up, Li’l Z’.
You’ve punished him enough.

816
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:48,250
You know the law.

817
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,120
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

818
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:53,930
That was his business, Li’l Z’.

819
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,730
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

820
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,030
You showed no respect, understand?

821
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,870
You know what, Benny?

822
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,640
You’re too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

823
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,720
He wasn’t worth shit.

824
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,920
-A dirty traitor.
-Shut up, Tuba.

825
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,490
I’m going for a walk
with my girl.

826
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:21,860
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

827
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,090
we’ll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

828
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,100
You need a girlfriend, Li’l Z’.

829
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,660
Know what I’m thinking, Benny?

830
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,790
That I’m so sexy?

831
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,560
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

832
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:06,260
-Make love again.
-I’m serious.

833
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:11,570
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

834
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,180
Go where?

835
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,920
To a farm.

836
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,490
We’re really hippies at heart,
aren’t we?

837
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,020
A farm?

838
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,960
Peace and love?

839
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:56,550
BENNY’S FAREWELL

840
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:08,530
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

841
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,360
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

842
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,870
The gangs...

843
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,530
The soul crowd...

844
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:27,480
-The religious crowd...
-One day, I’ll go to church.

845
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,620
The samba crowd...

846
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,490
The groovy crowd...

847
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:42,290
And Li’l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

848
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,180
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

849
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,790
-I didn’t hear...
-Want to dance?

850
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,090
No, thank you, I’m with someone.

851
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:28,340
Hey, Rocket!

852
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,700
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

853
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,730
-You can’t just split with that chick.
-Why not?

854
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:54,130
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

855
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,140
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

856
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:01,840
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

857
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:04,640
We’ll take over Carrot’s business,
it’ll be yours.

858
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:08,180
-Leave Carrot alone, he’s a good guy.
-He’s a motherfucker!

859
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,690
See? Everyone’s a motherfucker
to you. That’s why I’m leaving.

860
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,590
I’m your friend,
but I’m getting out.

861
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,030
You got to understand,
I have to go.

862
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:23,600
I love you, man,
but I’ve had enough.

863
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:25,200
Motherfucker, let’s see
if you have any balls.

864
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,990
-What is this?
-You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

865
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:32,730
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

866
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:37,310
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

867
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,070
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

868
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,080
Let’s go, nigger!

869
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:57,030
Show your ass to everyone!

870
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,260
Please...

871
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,860
-Strip, dammit!
-Hurry it up!

872
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:22,020
What’s up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

873
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,850
-I don’t deal anymore.
-C’mon, do it for me. You’re my friend.

874
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,720
-Is it stolen?
-It’s okay, it’s my dad’s.

875
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,450
Your dad’s?

876
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:38,770
-Give it to Li’l Z’.
-Rocket would love this camera.

877
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,640
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

878
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,500
Here I am!

879
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,830
-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah.

880
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,040
-Here’s a present.
-Shit, dude! This is great!

881
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:24,010
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

882
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,060
You’ll take some great pictures.

883
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:49,910
Give me that.

884
01:17:55,150 --> 01:18:01,380
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

885
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:10,990
What’s your problem?
Are you crazy?

886
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,750
They’ve killed Benny!

887
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,300
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where’s the motherfucker who did it?

888
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,130
-Z’, Benny is dead.
-No! Call a doctor!

889
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,280
Get out of here, bitch!
It’s your fault!

890
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,680
Motherfucker!

891
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,180
Where's Carrot?

892
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,040
Blacky's here.

893
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:42,010
He's in trouble.

894
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,820
I’m fucked.

895
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:48,280
-Why?
-I’m fucked.

896
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:51,360
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

897
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,690
Li’l Z’ is coming
to take your place.

898
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,160
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

899
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,000
You killed Benny?

900
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,730
I didn’t mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’l Z’.

901
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,100
Come on, let’s go.

902
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,800
Blacky...

903
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:09,640
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

904
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:12,110
Let’s go get Li’l Z’.

905
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:24,760
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

906
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,060
We’re fucked, man.

907
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:42,950
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

908
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,490
Look who’s here.
My sugar babe.

909
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,350
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girl.

910
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,520
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

911
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,620
Come on, Li’l Z’.

912
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,600
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

913
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:24,920
The problem was simple. Li’l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

914
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:31,190
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li’l Z' had to pay or use force.

915
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:35,460
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...

916
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,830
and the ugly bad guy.

917
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,600
-Let me go!
-Just enjoy it.

918
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:53,370
There’s no use fighting.
You’re mine now.

919
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,820
Hey, faggot, your broad’s
really hot!

920
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:35,420
I can’t even look her in
the face now.

921
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:48,910
Why didn’t that fucker kill me?

922
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:57,110
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

923
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,480
Let’s go back.

924
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,480
-What about Carrot?
-We’ll get back to him.

925
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:03,920
You gonna kill him?

926
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,690
Knockout Ned, your chick’s a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

927
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:17,340
-Come out, you loser!
-Take it easy...

928
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,670
I’m going out. Let me go.

929
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,150
Gerson! Come back, son!

930
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,570
This doesn’t concern you, kid.
We’re here for your brother.

931
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:55,140
Let’s talk, we can work it out.
My brother’s a peaceful guy.

932
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:58,540
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

933
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,010
He hasn't done anything.

934
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:03,880
You know who I am?

935
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,140
-Li’l Z’, man.
-He’s Li’l Z’.

936
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,620
Call that motherfucker!

937
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:18,160
Go on, man.

938
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,960
Calm down, I’ll call him.

939
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:57,970
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

940
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:00,500
That loser got what he deserved.

941
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,700
Let’s go!

942
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:30,370
Gerson...

943
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:34,160
That bastard killed my brother.

944
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,880
I can’t let that go.

945
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,230
-Want a gun?
-My son...

946
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:05,840
Calm down, mom.

947
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:09,540
Please, mom...

948
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:22,010
Do it right, asshole.

949
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,950
-There’s no other way.
-How’d I let that loser hit me?

950
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,630
Shit, that’s some hole.

951
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,350
-It’s as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

952
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:06,090
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

953
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:10,100
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

954
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:16,400
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

955
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:20,810
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

956
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:32,520
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

957
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:34,890
God bless you, son.

958
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:38,360
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

959
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,260
Well done.

960
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:44,700
You did a good job.

961
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,530
You’d better go hide.

962
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,410
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

963
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:57,380
But God had other plans.

964
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,280
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

965
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:04,750
They’re hiding.
Li’l Z’ is in a bad mood.

966
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,690
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

967
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:12,130
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

968
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,730
I’ll try.

969
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:17,390
Tell them it’s for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

970
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:43,360
Steak’n’fries,
go to Carrot’s and tell him...

971
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,930
Li’l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he’ll leave you alone.

972
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:52,430
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

973
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,300
Grab the kid!

974
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,140
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

975
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:06,610
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

976
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:10,220
Drugs aren't my thing.

977
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,550
This is just something
between me and him.

978
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:17,420
Those guys aren’t worth shit.

979
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:21,220
They'll do anything for power.

980
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:23,770
Like that kid.

981
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:28,100
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

982
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,570
What’s in your head, kid?

983
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:33,210
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

984
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:37,640
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

985
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:45,780
-Are you crazy? You’re just a kid.
-A kid? I smoke, snort...

986
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,290
I’ve killed and robbed.
I’m a man.

987
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:52,020
Shit, you have no idea!

988
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,460
He’s attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

989
01:29:55,670 --> 01:30:00,540
-Shall we kill him?
-Steak, we're going to grind you.

990
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:06,370
-Okay, I accept.
-Great!

991
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:10,670
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

992
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:17,080
But on one condition:
no killing of innocent people.

993
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,320
I can't accept that, understand?

994
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:26,190
Okay, no innocent people.

995
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,540
Steak fucked up!

996
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,810
-Have you a gun for me?
-No...

997
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:50,420
but we can hold up
a gun store.

998
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,680
That’s no problem.

999
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:56,490
I don’t want to hold up anything.
I’m not a hoodlum.

1000
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:59,890
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1001
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,830
I’m not a hoodlum.

1002
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,170
He raped your chick...

1003
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:11,210
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

1004
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:14,780
and you killed one of his guys.

1005
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,750
If you’re not a hood,
then get out.

1006
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:32,260
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

1007
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:35,920
This is a hold-up!

1008
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:47,600
-The first time...
-Where are the revolvers?

1009
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:51,440
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

1010
01:31:51,650 --> 01:31:56,050
We said no killing!

1011
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,050
That’s the rule.

1012
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:04,520
We want the boss’ money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

1013
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:07,630
You want us to go?
We do too.

1014
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:10,270
So hurry up!

1015
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,900
-Look at the ground!
-The second time...

1016
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,040
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

1017
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:21,940
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

1018
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,910
Exception to the rule.

1019
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:28,210
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1020
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:32,410
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1021
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,650
On the ground!

1022
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:39,090
Give me the money!

1023
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:44,260
I’m not kidding.

1024
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,700
The first person who moves
is dead!

1025
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:50,730
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

1026
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,890
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li’l Z'.

1027
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,890
Carrot could protect his
business.

1028
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,930
Knockout Ned...

1029
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:19,070
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

1030
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:23,470
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1031
01:33:24,210 --> 01:33:26,440
-Let me see.
-Not bad, eh?

1032
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:31,340
-The sight isn’t well-aligned.
-I’ll give you a good price.

1033
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:34,140
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

1034
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:36,010
See why?

1035
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:39,280
An Uzi, 9 mm. It’s Israeli.

1036
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,360
-The star of David.
-Jewish.

1037
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,920
I want a 30-06.

1038
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:46,760
Now we can start having fun.

1039
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,300
The war’s on.
Let’s start with a prayer.

1040
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:55,760
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

1041
01:33:55,970 --> 01:34:00,140
Our will be done...

1042
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,170
On earth as it is in heaven...

1043
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,490
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1044
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,820
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li’l Z”s gang.

1045
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:27,160
Li’l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

1046
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:34,040
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1047
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:43,680
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

1048
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:46,990
Great photo!

1049
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:49,660
I bet it’s by Rogerio Reis.

1050
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:53,060
What did I tell you?

1051
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,460
Like any pro...

1052
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:59,100
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1053
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,760
Without knowing what awaited me.

1054
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:07,380
Instead of going home
I’d go over to the paper.

1055
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:10,940
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1056
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:14,020
Check this out.

1057
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:18,280
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

1058
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:20,120
-Hi, Rogerio.
-How are you, Pierre?

1059
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,950
This is Rocket.
He’s a photographer.

1060
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,320
Hello, Rocket.

1061
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:26,790
-He’s a fan of yours.
-Really?

1062
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,620
You have good taste, Rocket!

1063
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:31,930
-Well, I’m done. I’m off.
-See you.

1064
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,800
What a cool guy!

1065
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:38,700
What should have been
a swift revenge...

1066
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:41,400
turned into an all-out war.

1067
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,750
The City of God was divided.

1068
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:52,750
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

1069
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,190
Not even to visit a relative.

1070
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:59,120
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1071
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:02,770
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1072
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:11,930
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1073
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,130
This kid...

1074
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,070
-What do you want?
-A boy from Carrot’s gang punched me.

1075
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,980
The war was
an excuse for everything.

1076
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:20,350
One of Li’l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.

1077
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,410
Take this .22.

1078
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,690
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1079
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:30,290
Li’l Z’ evicted my family.

1080
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:32,960
Kill... Be respected.

1081
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:50,800
-I’m Thiago, a friend of Benny’s.
-Can you read? Can you add?

1082
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:56,450
-I’m pretty good in business.
-Okay, get to work.

1083
01:36:56,950 --> 01:37:00,320
-What do you want?
-To get my father’s murderer.

1084
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,490
-What’s your name?
-My name’s Otto.

1085
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,900
What’s the matter?

1086
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:15,060
-He’s a worker.
-But he wants a gun.

1087
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:18,470
He won’t last a week.

1088
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:34,320
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

1089
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,860
Take that!

1090
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:44,600
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

1091
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,330
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

1092
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:13,360
I smoke, snort,
I’ve killed and robbed.

1093
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,900
I’m a man.

1094
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:42,580
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

1095
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:00,940
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

1096
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,870
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1097
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:06,480
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1098
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,910
Our reporter interviewed him.

1099
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:13,080
-Is the war still going on?
-It's still going on.

1100
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:17,880
-Have many people died?
-Many have died.

1101
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:20,220
Mostly innocent people.

1102
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:23,800
Just knowing me is enough...

1103
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,730
to get you killed by Li’l Z'.

1104
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:32,310
-The police don’t go in there?
-They go after me, not him.

1105
01:39:32,510 --> 01:39:38,850
I’ve been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.

1106
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,140
And they don’t arrest him.

1107
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,650
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1108
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:49,450
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1109
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,660
Motherfucker!

1110
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:03,430
I’m the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1111
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:07,200
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned’s.

1112
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,880
Keep looking.

1113
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,010
At least my name’s
got to be in there.

1114
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:13,910
-There’s nothing.
-Can you read?

1115
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,550
Just the pictures.

1116
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,580
Nothing.

1117
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:22,880
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1118
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:28,220
-It’s just the want ads.
-I don’t care, read everything!

1119
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:32,600
-But there aren’t any articles.
-Want a bullet in your head?

1120
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:38,100
Gotta show them who’s boss here.

1121
01:40:43,150 --> 01:40:46,840
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1122
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:51,720
Take my picture, man.

1123
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,050
I can’t work it.

1124
01:40:55,260 --> 01:40:56,950
Go ahead.

1125
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:01,890
-I’ll hold the Beretta.
-Let me try...

1126
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:05,230
Back off...

1127
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,700
-There’s no click.
-What a bunch of bozos!

1128
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:12,970
I’m fucked with you guys.

1129
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,610
I have an idea.

1130
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:22,340
I’ll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1131
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:27,120
-Here he is.
-Take the camera.

1132
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:30,260
Well, kid?

1133
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:36,730
Aren’t you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can’t do it.

1134
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,330
Take our picture.

1135
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,080
-You fucking broke it.
-It wasn’t me.

1136
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:51,340
I found it.

1137
01:41:53,180 --> 01:41:55,340
It has to be wound.

1138
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,780
-What’s your name?
-Rocket.

1139
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:07,100
-Another picture, Rocket.
-How about two rows?

1140
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:12,200
-What?
-Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1141
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:17,000
-You’re outside, for Christ’s sake!
-Talk to him nicely, kid.

1142
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:19,140
Sorry. Move in, please.

1143
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,110
Another one.

1144
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:30,780
-I think the roll’s finished.
-Then show us the pictures.

1145
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:33,850
-They have to be developed.
-Developed?

1146
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:36,750
How much is it?

1147
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:41,760
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1148
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:47,230
-I have to remove the film.
-Keep the camera.

1149
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:52,140
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn’t he? So, it’s yours...

1150
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:54,170
Thanks.

1151
01:42:56,110 --> 01:43:00,310
Don’t forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1152
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,730
-Pierre!
-What?

1153
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:17,500
Can you develop this for me?

1154
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:21,660
I can’t, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1155
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:24,600
It’s only for the paper’s reporters.
I could risk my job.

1156
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:26,300
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1157
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:31,140
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1158
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:33,910
I’m going to lunch.

1159
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,210
You’re lucky. What size?

1160
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,820
-What?
-For the enlargement, what size?

1161
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:46,090
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1162
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,010
-Here.
-Thanks.

1163
01:44:11,890 --> 01:44:14,550
I’m in deep shit now.

1164
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:18,980
I’m as good as dead.

1165
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,330
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1166
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:36,000
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1167
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,310
Are you Marina?
Because of you I’m dead.

1168
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,650
You stole my photos.

1169
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:51,730
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1170
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:55,550
Not so loud?
I’ll be killed because of you.

1171
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:58,330
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1172
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:01,370
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

1173
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:04,370
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1174
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,840
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1175
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,440
-You stole them.
-I did not. Here they are.

1176
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:15,020
-Give them to me.
-Just a second.

1177
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:18,350
Here are your photos.

1178
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:22,320
-Are there any others?
-Calm down. What’s your name?

1179
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,820
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1180
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:28,930
Nice to meet you.
I’m Marina.

1181
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:34,630
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1182
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:40,070
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1183
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,300
-Do you want to be a photographer?
-Yes.

1184
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:47,380
-Great start! On the front page.
-How’d you get these photos?

1185
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:49,140
-I live there.
-Rocket...

1186
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:53,590
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1187
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:59,690
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’l Z’...

1188
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:04,920
the paper would buy them.
We’d pay you.

1189
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:07,190
Could you?

1190
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,270
I don’t know.

1191
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:10,940
What’s the problem?

1192
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:13,970
The problem? I can’t go there
anymore at night.

1193
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:18,440
-And during the day?
-It’s too risky.

1194
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:25,580
Look, man! They’ve finally
understood that I’m the boss.

1195
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,020
What’s your
photographer-friend’s name?

1196
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:30,450
Rocket.

1197
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:33,860
He’s good. I’ll take more
to show the others.

1198
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:40,300
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1199
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:45,540
It’s a great opportunity.

1200
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:48,880
Okay.

1201
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,710
-You made the right choice. Very good!
-I’ll give you some film, lenses...

1202
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:00,620
and even another camera.
I’ll show you the equipment room.

1203
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:04,090
There’s another problem.

1204
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:07,320
-What is it?
-Where can I sleep tonight?

1205
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,760
I can’t go back now.

1206
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,100
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1207
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,300
Far away.

1208
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,300
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

1209
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:27,210
Aren’t you too close?

1210
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:33,250
I don’t know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

1211
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,650
Maybe I was going to die...

1212
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:39,260
but now I had a camera...

1213
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,160
and a chance to become
a photographer.

1214
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:45,130
Watch out for the dog shit.

1215
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:48,800
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

1216
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:52,370
-Want something to eat?
-No thank you, ma'am.

1217
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:58,280
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1218
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:01,310
Try this...

1219
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,230
It’s time to go to sleep.

1220
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:27,610
I’ll show you your bed.

1221
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:30,840
-You have hot water, don’t you?
-Yes.

1222
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:33,540
You’ve never taken a hot shower?

1223
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,980
-No.
-What do you do?

1224
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:39,420
We heat up the kettle.

1225
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:43,490
-Why are you standing there?
-What room do I sleep in?

1226
01:48:43,690 --> 01:48:49,830
Unfortunately, there’s only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1227
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:53,700
I won’t go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1228
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:57,000
Just relax...

1229
01:48:57,610 --> 01:48:59,510
Because, elsewhere...

1230
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:04,370
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

1231
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:08,110
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...

1232
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,950
without firing a shot.

1233
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:18,380
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

1234
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,150
And in the meantime...

1235
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:23,760
to eliminate Carrot, Li’l Z'
was investing in munitions.

1236
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:26,700
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn’t pay...

1237
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,400
-Remember the double-barrel?
-I already have it.

1238
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:36,370
This is a repeater rifle. You don’t have
this one, the Browning.

1239
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:39,670
-It’ll shoot down a plane.
-I’m not shooting down planes.

1240
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,180
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1241
01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:46,820
You can’t get them in Brazil.

1242
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:49,010
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1243
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,190
I have a solution.

1244
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,090
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1245
01:49:56,300 --> 01:50:00,830
It’s like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1246
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,440
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1247
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,470
-It depends.
-It depends, my ass!

1248
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,240
Trying to fuck me over?

1249
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:12,440
I’ll fuck you over first.

1250
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:15,550
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1251
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:19,280
-What do I tell the boss?
-That’s your problem.

1252
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:23,650
-You’ll think of something.
-You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1253
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:27,390
Beat it, fatso.

1254
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,150
Li’l Z' had made a big mistake.

1255
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:33,660
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

1256
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:36,100
And they don't joke around.

1257
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:40,170
Have you seen this?

1258
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,940
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1259
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:46,110
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1260
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:48,580
They’ll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1261
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:53,410
Think I’m going
to give you away?

1262
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:59,190
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

1263
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:01,560
But don’t fuck up again.

1264
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:10,500
Charlie!

1265
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:13,110
Come here!

1266
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:14,870
Listen...

1267
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:17,770
you tell him...

1268
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:22,680
Let’s go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1269
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,420
Come here, kids!

1270
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:42,030
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.

1271
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:45,640
We’ll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1272
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,170
I have a present for you.

1273
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:52,940
Here...

1274
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:56,770
A big one for you.

1275
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:59,010
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1276
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:03,950
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1277
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:06,890
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1278
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,790
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1279
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,790
-More or less.
-More or less?

1280
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,460
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1281
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,960
I know. You do it like this.

1282
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:29,510
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1283
01:52:38,230 --> 01:52:39,220
Get that chicken!

1284
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,700
C'mon, let’s go.

1285
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:55,840
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

1286
01:52:57,850 --> 01:53:00,710
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

1287
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:11,850
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1288
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,990
Shit! The cops!

1289
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,260
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1290
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:20,330
Give me that.

1291
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:33,950
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1292
01:53:34,150 --> 01:53:37,280
Get the hell out of here!

1293
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:38,850
Coward!

1294
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:41,080
Asshole!

1295
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:44,960
Come on, let them kill each other.

1296
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,890
They can fuck themselves.

1297
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:58,530
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1298
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:02,240
What are you waiting for?

1299
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:25,590
What’s happening?

1300
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:27,370
Shit!

1301
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:42,350
Let’s go!

1302
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:17,040
Run! Run!

1303
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:20,120
Watch out!

1304
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,310
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1305
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:45,410
Knockout Ned!

1306
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:01,990
Take it easy. Don’t move.

1307
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,930
It hurts, man.

1308
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:06,690
Easy does it, kid.

1309
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:10,360
Why did you join this fucking war?

1310
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:13,300
Knockout Ned!
Li’l Z’ has been hit. Come on!

1311
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,670
Wait here, I’ll help you.
Just hold on.

1312
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:31,190
-What's your name?
-My name's Otto.

1313
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:41,220
I want to get my father’s murderer.

1314
01:57:05,830 --> 01:57:08,290
Knockout Ned! Li’l Z’ has been hit.
Come on!

1315
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:14,000
I’ll help you.
Just hold on there.

1316
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,470
The fucking cops!

1317
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:58,110
On the ground!

1318
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:00,210
-Hands over your head.
-Don't move!

1319
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:14,760
-You’re the one I want.
-You’re finished, pal.

1320
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,020
Handcuff him.

1321
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:35,570
Rocket, where are you going?

1322
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:38,250
I got something to clear up.

1323
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:11,170
Okay, lovebirds?

1324
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:15,080
Come on, Li’l Z',
let’s go settle our scores.

1325
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:20,020
Not you. You’re a present
for the media.

1326
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:57,560
Does it come to 10,000?

1327
01:59:57,770 --> 02:00:00,830
Almost. That’s all I have.

1328
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:04,400
-That’s all there was, Chief.
-We searched everywhere.

1329
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:07,100
Let him go.

1330
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:14,410
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1331
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:20,520
Fill it up. You’ll owe us
the rest.

1332
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:26,520
Fucking war!

1333
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:31,320
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1334
02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:33,800
You're fucked, eh?

1335
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,260
Kids...

1336
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:39,370
we’ll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1337
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:42,510
-Your business, Li’l Z’?
-What’s your problem, kid?

1338
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:45,370
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1339
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:47,100
A Soviet attack!

1340
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:57,360
The business is ours!

1341
02:01:51,150 --> 02:01:55,450
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

1342
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:59,650
This one will make me famous.

1343
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:02,620
It’ll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1344
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:08,520
I won’t have to worry
about Li’l Z' anymore.

1345
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:13,160
But the cops?

1346
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:24,940
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1347
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:31,980
This photo could’ve gotten
us killed?

1348
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:33,740
I think so.

1349
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:36,650
At least it got you a job.

1350
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:40,690
-Not a job, an internship.
-It pays a little, doesn’t it?

1351
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:43,330
A little.

1352
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,570
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1353
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:49,130
-More or less.
-You didn’t like it?

1354
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:51,770
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

1355
02:02:51,970 --> 02:02:52,960
Yeah, I guess so.

1356
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:55,540
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

1357
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:57,330
Better kill him.

1358
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,210
Who shot Roger?

1359
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:01,750
-It was Beef.
-Kill that fucker.

1360
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:04,320
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1361
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:08,010
-What about Cherry?
-Let’s go. Us two, and 3 others...

1362
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,090
It’s a deal.

1363
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:12,880
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1364
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:16,390
No, but if they come,
we’ll kill them.

1365
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:21,030
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, sort of.

1366
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,270
Let’s make a black list.
We’ll kill them all.

1367
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:28,030
-Put fucking Nightowl on there.
-And Croquet.

1368
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,770
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1369
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:31,910
And China-Man,
he thinks he’s hot stuff.

1370
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:35,100
-And Claudio.
-Where’s Giant?

1371
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,050
Come on, Giant!

1372
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:56,160
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1373
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:58,600
BASED ON A REAL STORY
I’m now Wilson Rodrigues...

1374
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:00,500
photographer.

1375
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:23,330
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1376
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:26,620
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1377
02:04:26,830 --> 02:04:29,830
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

1378
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:33,100
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1379
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:36,940
Just knowing me is enough...

1380
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:40,980
just being my friend...

1381
02:04:41,180 --> 02:04:45,120
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.

1382
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:47,220
