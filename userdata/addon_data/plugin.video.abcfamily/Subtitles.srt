00:00:02,33 --> 00:00:03,79
I think we should<br></br>give it a shot.

3
00:00:03,79 --> 00:00:04,79
I do, too.

4
00:00:04,79 --> 00:00:05,88
Is that what this is?

5
00:00:05,88 --> 00:00:07,58
Your master plan to get me<br></br>to sleep with you?

6
00:00:07,58 --> 00:00:09,00
I love you, Bianca.

7
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:11,54
Oh, my God. I love you, too.

8
00:00:11,54 --> 00:00:14,08
Just because I want to have sex<br></br>doesn't mean I should.

9
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:15,54
I've been fooled by guys<br></br>like you before,

10
00:00:15,54 --> 00:00:16,54
but not his time.

11
00:00:16,54 --> 00:00:18,25
I'm on <span tts:fontStyle="italic" >The Biggest Poser.</span>

12
00:00:18,25 --> 00:00:19,92
I leave for New York tomorrow.

13
00:00:41,29 --> 00:00:43,38
I miss my boyfriend.

14
00:00:43,38 --> 00:00:45,21
Joey left two days ago.

15
00:00:45,21 --> 00:00:46,33
I can still smell<br></br>his body spray.

16
00:00:46,33 --> 00:00:48,08
That's because<br></br>I'm wearing it.

17
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:49,42
To remember him.

18
00:00:49,42 --> 00:00:50,42
He's not dead.

19
00:00:50,42 --> 00:00:51,79
He's just on a reality TV show,

20
00:00:51,79 --> 00:00:52,79
which is probably worse.

21
00:00:52,79 --> 00:00:54,08
At least<br></br>there's dignity in death.

22
00:00:54,08 --> 00:00:55,29
Could you show<br></br>a little compassion?

23
00:00:55,29 --> 00:00:57,62
This is his locker.

24
00:00:57,62 --> 00:00:59,62
We shared so many kisses here.

25
00:00:59,62 --> 00:01:01,54
Here's a novel idea--<br></br>why don't you call him?

26
00:01:01,54 --> 00:01:03,71
Then he can listen to this<br></br>instead of me.

27
00:01:03,71 --> 00:01:05,46
I can't. He's sequestered<br></br>in the model house,

28
00:01:05,46 --> 00:01:06,75
and they only have one phone.

29
00:01:06,75 --> 00:01:08,38
Last night, some girl<br></br>told Joey to hang up

30
00:01:08,38 --> 00:01:09,83
or she'd scratch his face.

31
00:01:09,83 --> 00:01:12,00
I'd give anything to hear<br></br>the sound of his voice.

32
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:14,58
The Buddha says, "Desire is<br></br>the root of all suffering."

33
00:01:14,58 --> 00:01:15,75
Thanks, fortune cookie.

34
00:01:15,75 --> 00:01:17,25
Is that supposed<br></br>to make me feel better?

35
00:01:17,25 --> 00:01:18,75
The fact that you want<br></br>Joey to call

36
00:01:18,75 --> 00:01:20,42
is creating the pain<br></br>you're feeling right now.

37
00:01:20,42 --> 00:01:23,00
So what? I shouldn't<br></br>want him to call me?

38
00:01:20,42 --> 00:01:23,00
Exactly.

39
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:24,96
So you're not dying<br></br>to talk to Patrick

40
00:01:24,96 --> 00:01:25,96
about the other night?

41
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:29,17
If I wanted to talk<br></br>to him about it,<br></br>I'd call him.

42
00:01:29,17 --> 00:01:30,54
He's not in a model house.

43
00:01:30,54 --> 00:01:33,50
I'm walking my path,<br></br>and he's walking his.<br></br>I wish him well.

44
00:01:33,50 --> 00:01:35,25
You're so deluded.

45
00:01:37,54 --> 00:01:38,92
Whoa, wait a second.

46
00:01:38,92 --> 00:01:40,46
Why is Dad talking<br></br>to Miss Tharp?

47
00:01:40,46 --> 00:01:43,17
Maybe he's worried<br></br>you're an android.

48
00:01:44,58 --> 00:01:46,92
Oh, my God, they're dating.

00:01:57,58 --> 00:01:59,21
Bianca, calm down.

52
00:01:59,21 --> 00:02:02,96
Try and imagine we're bamboo<br></br>gently bending in the wind.

53
00:02:02,96 --> 00:02:05,62
And hurricane Tharp<br></br>is about to rip us to shreds.

54
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,17
We don't know they're dating.

55
00:02:07,17 --> 00:02:09,04
Maybe they were reminiscing<br></br>about your fake intervention.

56
00:02:09,04 --> 00:02:11,04
I am an expert<br></br>on flirty body language.

57
00:02:11,04 --> 00:02:13,17
She did<br></br>the hair flip/arm squeeze

58
00:02:13,17 --> 00:02:16,00
which means they've been<br></br>on two dates

59
00:02:16,00 --> 00:02:18,08
and they've made out<br></br>with tongue.

60
00:02:18,08 --> 00:02:21,04
What are we going to do<br></br>about this unholy union?

61
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:22,12
We support Dad.

62
00:02:22,12 --> 00:02:24,17
We've been wanting him<br></br>to date for years, remember?

63
00:02:24,17 --> 00:02:26,42
Someone age-appropriate<br></br>who works at the hospital,

64
00:02:26,42 --> 00:02:28,75
not the crazy lady from school<br></br>with zero boundaries.

65
00:02:28,75 --> 00:02:30,12
Dad's coming.

66
00:02:30,12 --> 00:02:31,92
If you say anything,<br></br>I will hurt you.

67
00:02:31,92 --> 00:02:33,33
I thought Buddhists<br></br>were nonviolent.

68
00:02:33,33 --> 00:02:35,04
I'm a beginner.

69
00:02:35,04 --> 00:02:36,38
Hi, girls.

70
00:02:36,38 --> 00:02:37,38
Hi, Daddy.

71
00:02:36,38 --> 00:02:37,38
Hi, Dad.

72
00:02:37,38 --> 00:02:38,42
How was your day?

73
00:02:38,42 --> 00:02:40,29
Uneventful.

74
00:02:38,42 --> 00:02:40,29
Yep.

75
00:02:40,29 --> 00:02:42,46
They ran this guy's shorts<br></br>up the flagpole at lunch.

76
00:02:42,46 --> 00:02:43,75
That was funny.

77
00:02:43,75 --> 00:02:45,12
And then we saw you<br></br>flirting with Miss Tharp.

78
00:02:45,12 --> 00:02:46,58
Bianca.

79
00:02:46,58 --> 00:02:48,00
She thinks you two are dating.

80
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:50,29
What? That's absurd.

81
00:02:53,04 --> 00:02:54,83
All right, I'm not going<br></br>to lie to you.

82
00:02:54,83 --> 00:02:55,92
We've been on two dates.

83
00:02:55,92 --> 00:02:57,04
Told you.

84
00:02:57,04 --> 00:02:58,58
I'm sorry I didn't<br></br>tell you sooner,

85
00:02:58,58 --> 00:03:00,58
but I wanted to wait till I<br></br>knew it was something special.

86
00:03:00,58 --> 00:03:02,08
See, Bianca?<br></br>It's nothing special.

87
00:03:02,08 --> 00:03:03,71
Actually, it is.

88
00:03:03,71 --> 00:03:05,00
Or it could be.<br></br>I don't know.

89
00:03:05,00 --> 00:03:06,46
She's funny<br></br>and surprising and--

90

20 years younger than you

91
00:03:08,04 --> 00:03:10,21
and our guidance counselor<br></br>and a weirdo.

92
00:03:11,33 --> 00:03:12,75
She's different,<br></br>and I like her.

93
00:03:12,75 --> 00:03:14,67
And when I'm around her,<br></br>I feel alive again.

94
00:03:14,67 --> 00:03:17,38
You know how, like,<br></br>when your foot goes asleep

95
00:03:17,38 --> 00:03:18,88
and you shake it<br></br>and it gets tingly?

96

97
00:03:19,96 --> 00:03:22,00
Ew, now you're bringing<br></br>feet into this?

Girls, you know you're

99
00:03:23,17 --> 00:03:25,08
the most important things<br></br>in my life.

100
00:03:25,08 --> 00:03:27,04
I won't date Miss Tharp<br></br>if you tell me not to.

101
00:03:27,04 --> 00:03:28,88
Okay, then don't.

102
00:03:28,88 --> 00:03:29,88
All right.

103
00:03:32,17 --> 00:03:35,04
I'll just be really sad.

104
00:03:35,04 --> 00:03:36,00
But that's okay

105
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:38,33
because your happiness<br></br>is more important than mine.

106
00:03:38,33 --> 00:03:41,96
Dad, we would never dream<br></br>of doing something so selfish.

107
00:03:41,96 --> 00:03:42,96
Would we, Bianca?

00:03:42,96 --> 00:03:44,08

109
00:03:44,08 --> 00:03:46,08
Why don't you<br></br>invite her over for dinner

110
00:03:46,08 --> 00:03:47,88
so that we can get<br></br>to know her better?

111
00:03:47,88 --> 00:03:49,79

Should I let it ring<br></br>one more time

115
00:03:54,17 --> 00:03:55,42
and not be too eager?

116
00:03:55,42 --> 00:03:58,08

Now, I know<br></br>our meditation collective

126
00:04:35,33 --> 00:04:37,08
has no official leader,

00:04:37,08 --> 00:04:39,75
but I have<br></br>a few announcements.

First of all,<br></br>welcome, Kat Stratford.

Joey, this is not good news.

00:06:05,83 --> 00:06:07,71
I think we both<br></br>know the answer to that.

161
00:06:07,71 --> 00:06:09,25
What's this?

162
00:06:09,25 --> 00:06:11,71
It's an invite<br></br>to my little sister's<br></br>birthday party.

163
00:06:11,71 --> 00:06:13,92

164
00:06:13,92 --> 00:06:17,62
All right, it's a love poem<br></br>for Dawn, okay?

166
00:06:18,62 --> 00:06:20,25
Did you write it<br></br>in calligraphy?

167
00:06:20,25 --> 00:06:21,25
So what if I did?

168
00:06:21,25 --> 00:06:23,67
Look, last night

169
00:06:23,67 --> 00:06:25,12
on the phone<br></br>without thinking,

170
00:06:25,12 --> 00:06:27,79
I said, "I got to get<br></br>some Z's, Dawn,"

171
00:06:27,79 --> 00:06:30,12
but I don't know<br></br>if she was done talking.

172
00:06:30,12 --> 00:06:32,54
Now I feel horrible.

173
00:06:32,54 --> 00:06:35,25
So I wrote her a poem<br></br>to apologize.

174
00:06:35,25 --> 00:06:37,75
For saying good night?<br></br>Nice backbone.

175
00:06:37,75 --> 00:06:39,00
Well, better to tell Dawn<br></br>how I feel

176
00:06:39,00 --> 00:06:40,25
than let her get away.

177
00:06:40,25 --> 00:06:42,08
That's the moral<br></br>of every romantic comedy.

178
00:06:52,33 --> 00:06:57,38

00:06:57,38 --> 00:06:58,38

00:07:05,54 --> 00:07:07,75
Thank you.

182
00:07:07,75 --> 00:07:09,08
It's so inviting.

183
00:07:09,08 --> 00:07:10,75
It's like I'm<br></br>on the set of <span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Friends.</span>

184
00:07:10,75 --> 00:07:11,75
[both laugh]

185
00:07:11,75 --> 00:07:12,75
Jennifer.

186
00:07:12,75 --> 00:07:13,96
Bianca, you love <span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Friends.</span>

187
00:07:13,96 --> 00:07:16,33
Why don't you discuss<br></br>this shared interest

188
00:07:16,33 --> 00:07:17,83
while I check the lasagna?

189
00:07:17,83 --> 00:07:19,33
[both chuckle]

190
00:07:20,79 --> 00:07:23,88
 Hey, did you hear <br></br><span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Friends </span>got canceled?

191
00:07:23,88 --> 00:07:26,33
Yes, but people love it<br></br>in reruns.

192
00:07:26,33 --> 00:07:28,04
And you know<br></br>why I think that is?

193
00:07:28,04 --> 00:07:30,04
Urban tribes are now<br></br>a substitute

194
00:07:30,04 --> 00:07:31,71
for traditional families.

195
00:07:31,71 --> 00:07:33,17
Yeah, plus it's funny.

196
00:07:35,12 --> 00:07:36,92
I'm sorry I'm late.<br></br>I was meditating.

197
00:07:36,92 --> 00:07:39,75
Dad, can I talk to you<br></br>about an amazing opportunity?

198
00:07:39,75 --> 00:07:42,12
Kat, I have no interest<br></br>in a timeshare right now,

199
00:07:42,12 --> 00:07:43,62
especially<br></br>when we have a guest.

200
00:07:43,62 --> 00:07:45,04
Oh, hi, Miss Tharp.

201
00:07:45,04 --> 00:07:46,21
<span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Namaste.</span>

202
00:07:46,21 --> 00:07:47,62
<span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Namaste, </span>Kat.

203
00:07:47,62 --> 00:07:48,79
Dad, I want to go to Nepal.

204
00:07:48,79 --> 00:07:50,04
And I'm sure<br></br>someday you will.

205
00:07:50,04 --> 00:07:51,71
How about next week?

206
00:07:50,04 --> 00:07:51,71
Huh?

207
00:07:51,71 --> 00:07:52,92
There's<br></br>a school sanction program

208
00:07:52,92 --> 00:07:54,75
where I'd spend three months<br></br>in a remote village

209
00:07:54,75 --> 00:07:56,42
in the Himalayas<br></br>helping them build a school.

210
00:07:56,42 --> 00:07:58,88
Plus, the trip is led<br></br>by university faculty members

211
00:07:58,88 --> 00:08:01,00
who'll teach courses<br></br>in East Asian history.

212
00:08:01,00 --> 00:08:02,38
And the best part--

213
00:08:02,38 --> 00:08:03,79
daily mediation at a monastery

214
00:08:03,79 --> 00:08:05,46
with real Buddhist monks.

215
00:08:05,46 --> 00:08:07,88
That sounds<br></br>like the perfect trip

216
00:08:07,88 --> 00:08:09,21
for someone else's daughter.

217
00:08:09,21 --> 00:08:11,71
Let her go. I'll turn<br></br>her room into a gym.

218
00:08:11,71 --> 00:08:15,62
I know that program, Walter.<br></br>It's very well run.

219
00:08:15,62 --> 00:08:16,96
Not only<br></br>do the students achieve

220
00:08:16,96 --> 00:08:18,79
a higher level<br></br>of consciousness,

221
00:08:18,79 --> 00:08:20,75
but it looks great<br></br>on a college application.

222
00:08:22,92 --> 00:08:25,00
Don't say no yet.<br></br>Just think about it.

223
00:08:25,00 --> 00:08:26,33
I will.

224
00:08:26,33 --> 00:08:28,71
After dinner. Would you<br></br>take a seat, please?

225
00:08:28,71 --> 00:08:31,25
[Bianca]<br></br>So, Miss Tharp,

226
00:08:31,25 --> 00:08:32,83
have you ever been married?

227
00:08:32,83 --> 00:08:34,58
Bianca, what kind<br></br>of a question is that?

228
00:08:34,58 --> 00:08:37,54
No, it's okay, Walter.<br></br>I want this to be an open forum

229
00:08:37,54 --> 00:08:39,79
where we can all<br></br>share our truths.

230
00:08:39,79 --> 00:08:41,71
Great. So have you?

231
00:08:41,71 --> 00:08:45,12
I have been engaged<br></br>three times--

232
00:08:45,12 --> 00:08:48,71
four if you count<br></br>this one night in Vegas.

233
00:08:48,71 --> 00:08:51,04
But I haven't actually<br></br>quite made it down the aisle.

234
00:08:51,04 --> 00:08:52,67
Oh, why not?

235
00:08:52,67 --> 00:08:53,62
Bianca.

236
00:08:53,62 --> 00:08:55,67
Well, it's a question<br></br>I am currently trying

237
00:08:55,67 --> 00:08:57,21
to figure out in therapy.

238
00:08:57,21 --> 00:08:59,29
Enough questions.<br></br>This is a family dinner,

239
00:08:59,29 --> 00:09:00,75
not a deposition.

240
00:09:00,75 --> 00:09:04,21
Dad, I'm just trying to hear<br></br>Miss Tharp's truth.

241
00:09:04,21 --> 00:09:05,58
So have you<br></br>ever been arrested?

242
00:09:05,58 --> 00:09:06,67
[Walter and Kat]<br></br>Bianca!

243
00:09:06,67 --> 00:09:07,71
What?

244
00:09:07,71 --> 00:09:10,58
Yes, but I was<br></br>young and naive.

245
00:09:10,58 --> 00:09:12,58
Girls, please learn<br></br>from my mistake.

246
00:09:12,58 --> 00:09:15,17
If a cute man asks you to carry<br></br>a package over the border,

247
00:09:15,17 --> 00:09:17,42
don't do it.

248
00:09:17,42 --> 00:09:18,88
Don't ever do<br></br>what cute men want,

249
00:09:18,88 --> 00:09:19,88
unless it's me.

250
00:09:19,88 --> 00:09:21,67
[all chuckle]

251
00:09:21,67 --> 00:09:22,92
[phone rings]

252
00:09:22,92 --> 00:09:24,58
Oh, my God, Joey?

253
00:09:24,58 --> 00:09:26,12
Babe, I've been missing--

254
00:09:26,12 --> 00:09:27,38
Give that back, Dad.

255
00:09:27,38 --> 00:09:28,92
Bianca, we have<br></br>a dinner guest.

256
00:09:28,92 --> 00:09:31,12
You can talk to Joey later.

257
00:09:28,92 --> 00:09:31,12
No, I can't.

258
00:09:31,12 --> 00:09:34,04
You just sit there and be<br></br>polite or go to your room.

259
00:09:34,04 --> 00:09:36,17
[phone rings]

260
00:09:36,17 --> 00:09:38,67
I've been waiting for him<br></br>to call all day.

261
00:09:38,67 --> 00:09:40,08
You're ruining my life.

262
00:09:41,50 --> 00:09:42,83
Darlene, I'm sorry.

263
00:09:42,83 --> 00:09:45,04
Bianca can be<br></br>a bit over-dramatic.

264
00:09:45,04 --> 00:09:47,42
A bit? It's like she's<br></br>living in a telenovela.

265
00:09:47,42 --> 00:09:49,12
[laughs]

266
00:09:49,12 --> 00:09:50,42
Let's not let it ruin our meal.

267
00:10:01,71 --> 00:10:02,71
[knock on door]

268
00:10:03,79 --> 00:10:05,33
May I come in?

269
00:10:05,33 --> 00:10:06,83
I don't mean to be rude,

270
00:10:06,83 --> 00:10:08,38
but I don't want<br></br>to share my truth

271
00:10:08,38 --> 00:10:10,21
or do mirror work<br></br>or do any of that crap.

272
00:10:10,21 --> 00:10:11,62
I just want to be alone.

273
00:10:12,46 --> 00:10:14,25
I can tell<br></br>how much you miss him.

274
00:10:14,25 --> 00:10:15,67
I love him.

275
00:10:15,67 --> 00:10:18,04
And he's gone.

276
00:10:18,04 --> 00:10:20,17
And who knows<br></br>when the model phone<br></br>will be free again.

277
00:10:20,17 --> 00:10:23,54
Oh, I remember what it<br></br>feels like to be your age

278
00:10:23,54 --> 00:10:25,58
and in love.

279
00:10:25,58 --> 00:10:28,04
His name was Diego.

280
00:10:28,04 --> 00:10:30,58
When he got deported,<br></br>I thought my life was over.

281
00:10:30,58 --> 00:10:33,83
And the worst part about it--<br></br>nobody took my pain seriously.

282
00:10:33,83 --> 00:10:36,08
They're so insensitive.

283
00:10:36,08 --> 00:10:37,42
I'm sure they're<br></br>doing their best,

284
00:10:37,42 --> 00:10:40,42
but not everybody's equipped<br></br>to give us what we need.

285
00:10:40,42 --> 00:10:42,42
I'm here.

286
00:10:42,42 --> 00:10:43,58
I'm a good listener.

287
00:10:45,17 --> 00:10:46,58
Thanks, Miss Tharp.

288
00:10:46,58 --> 00:10:49,62
Oh, please call me Darlene.

289
00:10:51,42 --> 00:10:53,08
So how long have you guys<br></br>been together?

290
00:10:53,08 --> 00:10:56,25
We've been together<br></br>for about two months.

291
00:10:56,25 --> 00:10:59,54
Okay, Darlene, here I come.

292
00:10:59,54 --> 00:11:02,62
1, 2, 3.

293
00:11:02,62 --> 00:11:05,08
Oh, my God, I can't believe<br></br>we're wearing the same thing.

294
00:11:05,08 --> 00:11:06,46
You look so cute.

308
00:11:50,38 --> 00:11:52,12
to go halfway<br></br>around the world--

309
00:11:52,12 --> 00:11:55,42
Correction.<br></br>Only 12,130 kilometers,<br></br>give or take a few.

Oh, is that all?

I didn't realize you could<br></br>come home on weekends.

but this is<br></br>an amazing opportunity.

314
00:12:02,38 --> 00:12:04,92
And I'll be going off<br></br>to college in 18 months.

315
00:12:04,92 --> 00:12:06,25
Consider this<br></br>a dress rehearsal.

316
00:12:06,25 --> 00:12:08,62
For a play I don't want to see.

317
00:12:08,62 --> 00:12:10,71
I'm ready for this.

318
00:12:10,71 --> 00:12:12,92
Please don't keep me from<br></br>going because you're scared.

319
00:12:12,92 --> 00:12:15,67
I'm not scared.<br></br>I'm terrified.

320
00:12:12,92 --> 00:12:15,67
Of what?

321
00:12:15,67 --> 00:12:16,62
Of what?<br></br>You're going to a place

322
00:12:16,62 --> 00:12:18,71
without indoor plumbing<br></br>or telephones

323
00:12:18,71 --> 00:12:21,08
or parental supervision.<br></br>It's dangerous.

Some warlord's going to pay<br></br>seven goats for you.

00:12:23,58 --> 00:12:25,58
Seven goats?

326
00:12:23,58 --> 00:12:25,58
Yes.

00:12:25,58 --> 00:12:27,75
Dad, you can just say no.<br></br>You don't have to insult me.

00:12:32,58 --> 00:12:33,58

I've never let you<br></br>do anything in your life.

It's always been one<br></br>of my favorite things<br></br>about you.

00:13:57,58 --> 00:13:58,58
Cool.

356
00:13:59,96 --> 00:14:01,54
Have fun.

357
00:14:02,54 --> 00:14:04,04
You, too.

358
00:14:04,04 --> 00:14:06,67
[Dawn]<br></br>Your poem is<br></br>the most romantic thing

359
00:14:06,67 --> 00:14:08,71
any guy's ever done for me.

360
00:14:08,71 --> 00:14:09,75
Even that time Chris Yu

361
00:14:09,75 --> 00:14:11,92
scratched my name<br></br>on his guitar.

362
00:14:11,92 --> 00:14:14,75
I just wanted you to know<br></br>I couldn't live without you.

363
00:14:14,75 --> 00:14:17,92
Aw, recite it to me again.

364
00:14:17,92 --> 00:14:20,62
Hark, my Dawn.

365
00:14:20,62 --> 00:14:23,42
You are the sweetest treat<br></br>in the candy store.

366
00:14:23,42 --> 00:14:26,38
I've tasted your sugar,<br></br>and I want some more.

367
00:14:26,38 --> 00:14:28,71
You're so hot<br></br>you melt my heart.

368
00:14:28,71 --> 00:14:31,83
Lips, sweet and delicious,<br></br>like a mixed fruit tart.

369
00:14:31,83 --> 00:14:34,83
You're cuter than Bambi,<br></br>an adorable baby fawn.

370
00:14:34,83 --> 00:14:37,50
You light up my days,

371
00:14:37,50 --> 00:14:39,00
my very own Dawn.

372
00:14:39,00 --> 00:14:40,00
Oh.

373
00:14:45,54 --> 00:14:48,08
Check out all<br></br>that natural beauty.

374
00:14:48,08 --> 00:14:50,00
Eyeball exploding, right?

375
00:14:50,00 --> 00:14:53,50
You guys are in<br></br>for the journey of a lifetime.

376
00:14:53,50 --> 00:14:55,21
Maybe even a few lifetimes.

377
00:14:55,21 --> 00:14:56,54
[all laugh]

378
00:14:56,54 --> 00:14:58,17
That's a little<br></br>Buddhist humor.

379
00:14:58,17 --> 00:15:01,62
Sindu, that is too funny.

380
00:15:01,62 --> 00:15:03,96
I find your spirit infectious.

381
00:15:05,25 --> 00:15:06,75
Thanks.

382
00:15:06,75 --> 00:15:08,17
You're welcome.

383
00:15:08,17 --> 00:15:09,50
Do you know our host families?

384
00:15:09,50 --> 00:15:11,83
I'd like to start practicing<br></br>pronouncing their names.

385
00:15:11,83 --> 00:15:15,04
The families live<br></br>in one-room huts.

386
00:15:15,04 --> 00:15:16,04
It's a little crowded,

387
00:15:16,04 --> 00:15:18,42
so we'll be sleeping in tents.

388
00:15:18,42 --> 00:15:20,58
But it'll be spring,<br></br>so you know what that means.

389
00:15:20,58 --> 00:15:21,50
It won't be too cold?

390
00:15:21,50 --> 00:15:22,54
Avalanche season.

391
00:15:22,54 --> 00:15:23,83
But don't worry.

392
00:15:23,83 --> 00:15:25,50
You'll each<br></br>have a GPS tracker.

393
00:15:25,50 --> 00:15:27,46
I haven't lost a student yet.

394
00:15:27,46 --> 00:15:28,75
Just a toe.

395
00:15:28,75 --> 00:15:30,46
Now, let's talk vaccinations.

396
00:15:30,46 --> 00:15:33,67
You'll need hepatitis A and B,<br></br>typhoid, and tetanus,

397
00:15:33,67 --> 00:15:35,38
but good news,

398
00:15:35,38 --> 00:15:37,25
because of the new well<br></br>we dug last quarter,

399
00:15:37,25 --> 00:15:40,50
you'll no longer need the<br></br>Japanese encephalitis booster.

400
00:15:40,50 --> 00:15:43,83
One thing we can't vaccinate<br></br>against is dysentery.

401
00:15:43,83 --> 00:15:45,21
[sighs]

402
00:15:45,21 --> 00:15:46,46
I really wish we could,<br></br>though.

403
00:15:46,46 --> 00:15:49,38
But we can't. Questions?

404
00:15:49,38 --> 00:15:51,04
It's a non-invasive process

405
00:15:51,04 --> 00:15:52,54
that will really help you<br></br>access your--

406
00:15:52,54 --> 00:15:55,25
I hate to interrupt,<br></br>but this is an emergency.

407
00:15:55,25 --> 00:15:58,12
Oh, okay, just give me<br></br>a sec, Tanya,

408
00:15:58,12 --> 00:15:59,79
and then we'll start<br></br>the hypnosis.

409
00:15:59,79 --> 00:16:01,67
Hey, what is going on, honey?

410
00:16:01,67 --> 00:16:02,83
Joey called<br></br>during math class,

411
00:16:02,83 --> 00:16:04,42
and Mr. Meanly took<br></br>my phone away.

412
00:16:04,42 --> 00:16:07,12
Darlene, please help me<br></br>get it back.

413
00:16:07,12 --> 00:16:11,71
Bianca, honey, in this office,<br></br>I'm not Darlene.

414
00:16:11,71 --> 00:16:13,08
I'm Miss Tharp.

415
00:16:13,08 --> 00:16:16,58
And Miss Tharp has<br></br>to support Mr. Meanly.

416
00:16:16,58 --> 00:16:19,25
You should not be talking<br></br>on the phone during class.

417
00:16:19,25 --> 00:16:22,38
But you know how hard it's been<br></br>for me to not talk to Joey.

418
00:16:22,38 --> 00:16:25,04
Yesterday you called us<br></br>star-crossed lovers.

419
00:16:25,04 --> 00:16:27,21
And Darlene was<br></br>serious about that.

420
00:16:27,21 --> 00:16:28,83
Really?

421
00:16:28,83 --> 00:16:31,00
Because it sounds like<br></br>she was just sucking up to me

422
00:16:31,00 --> 00:16:32,29
so she could date my dad.

423
00:16:32,29 --> 00:16:34,12
No, she would never do that.

424
00:16:34,12 --> 00:16:36,25
In fact, if you want<br></br>to process this tonight

425
00:16:36,25 --> 00:16:38,92
over a pint of ice cream<br></br>and a Katherine Heigl movie,

426
00:16:38,92 --> 00:16:40,21
Darlene will be there.

427
00:16:40,21 --> 00:16:42,33
Tell Darlene I said<br></br>"Thanks for nothing."

428
00:16:55,42 --> 00:16:57,17
[Walter]<br></br>Bianca, be reasonable.

429
00:16:57,17 --> 00:16:58,75
I am being reasonable, Dad.

430
00:16:58,75 --> 00:17:00,92
She's the one with<br></br>multiple personality disorder.

431
00:17:00,92 --> 00:17:02,79
Darlene said you were<br></br>just upset

432
00:17:02,79 --> 00:17:04,29
because she wouldn't<br></br>give you your phone back.

433
00:17:04,29 --> 00:17:06,42
I'd hardly call that<br></br>a severe mental illness.

434
00:17:06,42 --> 00:17:07,58
This isn't about my phone.

435
00:17:07,58 --> 00:17:08,71
It's the fact that she's

436
00:17:08,71 --> 00:17:10,46
my guidance counselor<br></br>and your girlfriend.

437
00:17:10,46 --> 00:17:11,79
It's too confusing.

438
00:17:11,79 --> 00:17:14,12
All right, why don't we<br></br>just invite her over?

439
00:17:14,12 --> 00:17:16,08
And we'll share our truths.

440
00:17:16,08 --> 00:17:17,33
After all , if there can be

441
00:17:17,33 --> 00:17:19,00
a lasting peace<br></br>in Northern Ireland

442
00:17:19,00 --> 00:17:20,12
I'm sure we can work this out.

443
00:17:20,12 --> 00:17:21,50
Dad, you don't get it.

444
00:17:21,50 --> 00:17:22,79
I don't want to work this out.

445
00:17:22,79 --> 00:17:24,25
Now, please just leave me<br></br>to my homework.

446
00:17:24,25 --> 00:17:26,50
Bianca, wha--

447
00:17:24,25 --> 00:17:26,50
It's too strange.

448
00:17:26,50 --> 00:17:30,62
You said if we didn't want you<br></br>to date her, you'd stop.

449
00:17:30,62 --> 00:17:32,08
So stop.

450
00:17:32,08 --> 00:17:33,96
Okay, fine.

451
00:17:39,04 --> 00:17:40,75
See you in our<br></br>next class, okay?

452
00:17:40,75 --> 00:17:42,96
Siena, hey.

453
00:17:40,75 --> 00:17:42,96
Hi.

454
00:17:42,96 --> 00:17:45,08
Listen, I haven't been<br></br>able to find

455
00:17:45,08 --> 00:17:46,25
quick-drying snow pants<br></br>anywhere.

456
00:17:46,25 --> 00:17:47,42
Where did you get yours?

457
00:17:47,42 --> 00:17:50,17
Oh, Kat, I didn't tell you?

458
00:17:50,17 --> 00:17:51,42
I'm not going to Nepal.

459
00:17:52,46 --> 00:17:53,50
You're not?

460
00:17:53,50 --> 00:17:55,88
I realized<br></br>I don't like hiking,

461
00:17:55,88 --> 00:17:58,71
which means I'll probably<br></br>hate trekking.

462
00:17:58,71 --> 00:18:01,38
But have fun.<br></br>Take pictures.

463
00:18:04,00 --> 00:18:05,75
Hey.

464
00:18:07,00 --> 00:18:08,00
Hey back.

465
00:18:09,38 --> 00:18:11,62
I'm glad I caught you<br></br>before you left for Nepal.

466
00:18:11,62 --> 00:18:13,29
Really?

467
00:18:13,29 --> 00:18:15,00
Why?

468
00:18:18,88 --> 00:18:21,33
Keith found this<br></br>in the back of his van.

469
00:18:21,33 --> 00:18:23,71
I know how much you like it.

470
00:18:25,54 --> 00:18:27,08
Thanks.

471
00:18:27,08 --> 00:18:28,96
I was wondering where it was.

472
00:18:28,96 --> 00:18:30,54
In Keith's van.

473
00:18:31,54 --> 00:18:33,04
Yeah, you said that.

474
00:18:36,88 --> 00:18:38,12
I guess I'll see you around.

475
00:18:41,25 --> 00:18:42,75
Have a safe trip.

476
00:18:48,12 --> 00:18:49,96
Joey, I miss you so much.

477
00:18:49,96 --> 00:18:50,92
I miss you more.

478
00:18:50,92 --> 00:18:52,83
Co Liviette just fainted<br></br>during our photo shoot,

479
00:18:52,83 --> 00:18:55,38
so we have the phone<br></br>until she revives.

480
00:18:55,38 --> 00:18:57,08
Then she's going to want<br></br>to call her baby.

481
00:18:57,08 --> 00:18:58,88
Oh, goody, I hope<br></br>she's out for a while.

482
00:18:58,88 --> 00:19:00,50
We have so much to catch up on.

483
00:19:00,50 --> 00:19:04,17
Tomorrow's makeover day.<br></br>I'm so nervous.

484
00:19:04,17 --> 00:19:05,96
What if they shave my head?

485
00:19:05,96 --> 00:19:07,62
I don't know<br></br>how to work my skull.

486
00:19:07,62 --> 00:19:10,08
Joey, there's something<br></br>I have to do right now.

487
00:19:10,08 --> 00:19:11,29
Call me back later, okay?

488
00:19:11,29 --> 00:19:12,83
But--

489
00:19:11,29 --> 00:19:12,83
Love you. Bye.

490
00:19:13,92 --> 00:19:15,50
[sighs]

491
00:19:15,50 --> 00:19:16,96
<span tts:fontStyle="italic" >[Man on TV]<br></br>I'm on the other end.</span>

492
00:19:16,96 --> 00:19:18,62
<span tts:fontStyle="italic" >Yo, Tom, I thought<br></br>you brought it.</span>

493
00:19:18,62 --> 00:19:20,75
<span tts:fontStyle="italic" >You've got style.<br></br>You were sexy.</span>

494
00:19:20,75 --> 00:19:22,50
Looks good. Can I have some?

495
00:19:22,50 --> 00:19:25,67
Don't choke on it.

496
00:19:28,08 --> 00:19:30,67
Look.

497
00:19:30,67 --> 00:19:32,25
I'm sorry I freaked out<br></br>about Darlene.

498
00:19:32,25 --> 00:19:33,71
I was being selfish.

499
00:19:33,71 --> 00:19:35,21
Was?

500
00:19:35,21 --> 00:19:37,29
You mean you're not being<br></br>selfish anymore?

501
00:19:37,29 --> 00:19:38,88
Listen, I know how it feels

502
00:19:38,88 --> 00:19:40,83
to want to talk<br></br>to someone so badly it hurts.

503
00:19:40,83 --> 00:19:42,25
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br></br>Can I call her?

504
00:19:42,25 --> 00:19:44,88
Yeah, but...

505
00:19:44,88 --> 00:19:46,88
I'm switching to the other<br></br>guidance counselor.

506
00:19:46,88 --> 00:19:49,04
Deal.

507
00:19:46,88 --> 00:19:49,04
[phone rings]

508
00:19:49,04 --> 00:19:50,21
Joey.

509
00:19:50,21 --> 00:19:52,96
Don't worry<br></br>about your makeover.

510
00:19:52,96 --> 00:19:54,33
I told you<br></br>she'd come around.

511
00:19:54,33 --> 00:19:56,17
Listen, are you free to see<br></br>a movie this weekend?

512
00:19:56,17 --> 00:20:00,00
I have seen you model enough<br></br>to know you're a chameleon.

513
00:20:07,50 --> 00:20:09,42
What are you doing out here?

514
00:20:09,42 --> 00:20:11,38
The program recommends

515
00:20:11,38 --> 00:20:14,92
we try out all our equipment<br></br>before the trip.

516
00:20:14,92 --> 00:20:16,71
Can I ask you something weird?

517
00:20:16,71 --> 00:20:18,33
Where will you go<br></br>to the bathroom up there?

518
00:20:19,96 --> 00:20:20,96
Oh, God.

519
00:20:20,96 --> 00:20:23,79
You're so brave, Kat.

520
00:20:23,79 --> 00:20:25,92
I could never go to someplace<br></br>halfway around the world

521
00:20:25,92 --> 00:20:28,42
where I didn't know a soul<br></br>or speak the language

522
00:20:28,42 --> 00:20:30,54
or have any idea<br></br>what I'm eating,

523
00:20:30,54 --> 00:20:32,88
but it all sounds<br></br>so exciting and exotic.

524
00:20:32,88 --> 00:20:34,08
I don't want to go.

525
00:20:35,42 --> 00:20:37,54
I like indoor plumbing.

526
00:20:37,54 --> 00:20:39,12
I don't want<br></br>to forage for roots

527
00:20:39,12 --> 00:20:40,83
or wear snow pants.

528
00:20:40,83 --> 00:20:43,00
And--

529
00:20:40,83 --> 00:20:43,00
And what?

530
00:20:44,92 --> 00:20:47,08
And he didn't<br></br>try to stop me.

531
00:20:55,25 --> 00:20:57,04
I'm stopping you.

532
00:20:58,88 --> 00:21:02,25
I need you here.

533
00:21:02,25 --> 00:21:04,88
Dad is still dating<br></br>our guidance counselor,

534
00:21:04,88 --> 00:21:08,33
