v.2.0.6:
- Totally re-coded the service timing so it uses proper alarm calls. No more lockups.
- Fixed up some dialog messages, now if it doesn't force close it tells user to pull power.
- Fixed wipe kodi option in maintenance
- Fixed RunScript options in settings which had broken.

v.2.0.5:
- Fixed Option 1 (Fresh Install).
- Fixed Wipe option (was failing to keep Total Installer after wipe on Android).
- Added options to keep sources and favourites when installing a community build.
- Added service, this allows for internet connection check and CB notifications.
- Edited main menu so Community Builds always shows as a category but still needs unlocking.

v.2.0.4:
- Added missing countries.
- Fix guisettings step, old builds with TI installed were overwriting the newer version.
- Fix uploadlog for TI (typo in plugin ID for uploadlog module)
- Fix issue with special characters in user/pass.
- Wipe Kodi without the need for restart (load master profile).
- Add Isengard category to both the add-on and web form.
- Add option to show all builds (even those that may be marked as incompatible with system)
- Improved search functions so not quite as demanding on servers.
- Fixed the download count on add-on portal.
- Added check for download path and login that can be run directly from settings without the need for saving settings. Thank you DixieDean for that tip!
- Added reset option in settings, this will remove the addon_data/plugin.program.totalinstaller folder.

v.2.0.3:
- Small fix on startup video, added a close on the dialog which was covering up the video

v.2.0.2:
- Fixed wipe build option.
- Added internet check on startup.
- Added broken status on addon portal when browsing lists.

v.2.0.1:
- Minor update, some systems didn't like base64

Version 2.0:
- A complete re-write, all my own code apart from the handful of modules not obfuscated.
- The default.py is now obfuscated due to some morons stealing work without crediting the original author and also removing licenses.
Sorry about that, it goes against everything I believe in but until these idiots are dealt with it will stay this way.
